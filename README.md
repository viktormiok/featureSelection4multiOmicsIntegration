# featureSelection4multiOmicsIntegration
**Feature Selection for Multi-Omics Data Integration**, the repository presents a statistical workflow for feature selection in multi-omics datasets. The workflow is demonstrated using adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) genomics data, integrating eight different methods from three categories: **supervised methods, factor analysis, and network models**. The aim is to identify biologically relevant features across multiple omics layers, facilitating a holistic understanding of complex biological processes.

# Abstract 
Multi-omics data are collections of data from various categories of biomolecules belonging to a single sample or individual, collected using different techniques for each type
of biomolecule. Multi-omics data have become ubiquitous thanks to the advancement of
biomolecular research technologies, but many statistical methods remain on single-omics
data analysis, which leads to a poor overall understanding of complex biological processes. In
this thesis, we demonstrated a statistical workflow to select features from the multi-omic
adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) genomics data, using eight different methods from three
categories: Supervised methods, Factor analysis, and Network models. We concluded that
features selected using Factor analysis and Network models were more similar to each other,
with Supervised methods selecting a more different set of features.

# Introduction

Multi-omics data combine information from various biomolecular categories (e.g., genomics, proteomics, metabolomics) collected from the same biological samples. Integrated analysis of such data enables a holistic view of biological processes, with applications in disease research and nutrition science. This thesis develops and demonstrates a statistical workflow for feature selection in multi-omics data, using ACC cohort data as a case study [Zhuang_202...ter thesis | PDF].
