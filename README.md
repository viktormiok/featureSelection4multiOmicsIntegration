Feature Selection for Multi-Omics Data Integration

# Abstract 
Multi-omics data are collections of data from various categories of biomolecules belonging to a single sample or individual, collected using different techniques for each type
of biomolecule. Multi-omics data have become ubiquitous thanks to the advancement of
biomolecular research technologies, but many statistical methods remained on single-omics
data analysis, which lead to poor overall understanding of complex biological processes. In
this thesis, we demonstrated a statistical workflow to select features from the multi-omic
adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) genomics data, using eight different methods from three
categories: Supervised methods, Factor analysis, and Network models. We concluded that
features selected using Factor analysis and Network models were more similar to each other,
with Supervised methods selecting a more different set of features.
